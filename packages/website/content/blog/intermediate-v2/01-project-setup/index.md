## About the Instructor

- [Frontend Masters instructor](https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/mike-north/) for 9 years
- Developer Platform Lead @ [Stripe](https://stripe.com)
- Designs [Stripe's API semantics](https://stripe.com/docs/api)
- Architect responsible for TypeScript projects like [node-stripe](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-node), [Stripe Shell](https://stripe.sh/), and [Stripe Workbench](https://workbench.stripe.dev/)

## Top Goals for this course

- Pass along key knowledge gained through _thousands_ of hours of TypeScript teaching, Q&A and pair programming
- Give you a framework for **understanding _challenging_ type information**.
- Teach you how to understand and use a wide range of TypeScript's built-in utility types

This likely is pretty scary right now, but you'll know what it
means by the end of the course

```ts twoslash
// Get keys of type T whose values are assignable to type U
type FilteredKeys<T, U> = {
  [P in keyof T]: T[P] extends U ? P : never
}[keyof T] &
  keyof T

/**
 * get a subset of Document, consisting only of methods
 * returning an Element (e.g., querySelector) or an
 * Element[] (e.g., querySelectorAll)
 */
type ValueFilteredDoc = Pick<
  Document,
  FilteredKeys<
    Document,
    (...args: any[]) => Element | Element[]
  >
>
```

## What do you assume I already know?

- Modern javascript
- The basics of function, object and array types
- Basic generics (e.g., [TypeScript Fundamentals v4 - Generics](../../fundamentals-v4/14-generics/))
- Index signatures

Also... some practical experience always helps!

## Workshop Setup

As long as you can access the following websites, you should require no further setup :tada:

- [The course website you're reading right now](https://www.typescript-training.com/course/intermediate-v2)
- [The official TypeScript website](https://www.typescriptlang.org)

If you'd like to follow along with interactive examples, please install [Volta](https://volta.sh)

```sh
curl https://get.volta.sh | bash # Linux / macOS only
volta install node@lts yarn@^3
```

Make sure to follow the installation instructions for `volta` -- both what you see on the website and what you see in the CLI console. Next, clone the git repo for this course [github.com/mike-north/typescript-courses](https://github.com/mike-north/typescript-courses), enter the directory, and run `yarn` to install all dependencies

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mike-north/typescript-courses
cd typescript-courses
yarn
```

most of our work today will be in the `packages/notes-intermediate-ts-v2` folder

```sh
cd packages/notes-intermediate-ts-v2
```

## Which of your TypeScript courses is right for me?

I've made six TypeScript courses for Frontend Masters so far:

### Core

These courses focus on deep understanding of the programming language
and how the TS compiler models and checks your code. Most of the "class time" is
spent in a _lab environment_.

- [TypeScript Fundamentals (v4)](../../fundamentals-v4/) <br />
  By the end of this course, you'll have **a basic understanding of the TypeScript language**
- [Intermediate TypeScript (v2)](..) <br />
  By the end of this course, you'll be **prepared to contribute to a wide range of non-trivial TypeScript projects**. You
  could be well on your way to becoming the TypeScript expert on your team.

### Electives

These courses focus on _application_ of TypeScript to _solving problems at scale_.
Most of the "class time" is spent _building apps together_.

- [Enterprise TypeScript (v2)](../../enterprise-v2/) <br />
  This course focuses on **build pipelines, tooling, and practical use of TypeScript _at scale_**.
- [JS &amp; TS Monorepos (v1)](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/monorepos/) <br />
  This course focuses on _monorepos_ -- the concept of **multiple sub-projects existing in a single git repository**.
- [Making TypeScript Stick (v1)](../../making-typescript-stick/) <br />
  This course focuses on **hands-on practice defining advanced type information**.
- [Full Stack TypeScript, with Node.js and GraphQL (v1)](../../full-stack-typescript/) <br />
  This course focuses on **building a full stack, fully-typed medium sized web application**.
