## About the Instructor

- [Frontend Masters instructor](https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/mike-north/) for 9 years
- Developer Platform Lead @ [Stripe](https://stripe.com)
- Designs [Stripe's API semantics](https://stripe.com/docs/api)
- Architect responsible for TypeScript projects like [node-stripe](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-node), [Stripe Shell](https://stripe.sh/), and [Stripe Workbench](https://workbench.stripe.dev/)

## #1 Goal for this course

> By the end of this course, **I want you to have a rock solid mental model, that will allow you to design, discuss and understand types.**

## What is TypeScript?

> TypeScript is an [open source](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript), typed **syntactic superset** of JavaScript

- Compiles to clean, readable JS
- Three parts: [Language](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html), [Language Server](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) and [Compiler](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/tree/5c3045bc4f0d7b9a3e0d43cbf091ced99db8953c/src/compiler)
- Kind of like a fancy linter -- helps purely at build time

**TypeScript is _increasingly popular_**

## Why types are a big deal

It allows developers **to leave more of their intent "on the page"**, especially when it comes to **articulating constraints**.

This kind of _intent_ is often missing from JS code. For example:

```js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b
}
```

Is this meant to take numbers as args? strings? both?

What if someone who interpreted `a` and `b` as numbers made this "backwards-compatible change?"

```js
function add(a, b, c = 0) {
  return a + b + c
}
```

We're headed for trouble if we decided to pass strings in for `a` and `b`!

Types make the author's intent more clear

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2345
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b
}
add(3, "4")
```

This code is more readable and is more self-documenting, in that it's more clear how the author of this function intends it to be used.

**TypeScript moves some kinds of common programming errors from _runtime_ to _compile time_** [^1]

Examples:

- Values that are potentially absent (`null` or `undefined`)
- Incomplete refactoring
- Breakage around _internal code contracts_ (e.g., an argument _becomes_ required)

**It serves as the foundation for a _great_ code authoring experience**

Example: in-editor autocomplete, as shown here:

```ts twoslash
//@noErrors
window.se
//       ^|
```

## Workshop Setup

As long as you can access the following websites, you should require no further setup :tada:

- [The course website you're reading right now](https://www.typescript-training.com/course/fundamentals-v4)
- [The official TypeScript website](https://www.typescriptlang.org)

If you'd like to follow along with interactive examples, please install [Volta](https://volta.sh)

```sh
curl https://get.volta.sh | bash # Linux / macOS only
volta install node@lts yarn@^3
```

Make sure to follow the installation instructions for `volta` -- both what you see on the website and what you see in the CLI console. Next, clone the git repo for this course [github.com/mike-north/typescript-courses](https://github.com/mike-north/typescript-courses), enter the directory, and run `yarn` to install all dependencies

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mike-north/typescript-courses
cd typescript-courses
yarn
```

most of our work today will be in the `packages/notes-ts-fundamentals-v4` folder

```sh
cd packages/notes-ts-fundamentals-v4
```

[^1]: TypeScript by itself is not going to reduce the occurrence of errors in your projects. It does, however, provide several tools that _greatly_ improve visibility of some kinds of defects.
